<title>Divya Jay Prakash</title>
    <p>I'm a writer who enjoys learning things, talking to people, and chasing stories.
        I love words - I edit with a keen eye for grammar and shades of meaning, and I strive to put a unique flair into everything I write and do.
        I am a first-year student studying Cognitive Science and Comparative Literature.</p>
